___This is your first post!___

I wrote it for you so you can learn a bit about markdown and how to use it. 

You can make lists
  - Like this
  - this
  - or this and this
    

    function () {
      create.apply(['snippets','like','a','pro', true])
    };
    // (like a real pro)
    var coolness = ['you','and','all','your','friends'];
